# hass-opnsense

Join `OPNsense` with `Home Assistant`!

`hass-opnsense` uses the built-in `xmlrpc` service of `OPNsense` for all
interactions. This project is currently a proof-of-concept and may fail to work
at any time.

Initial development was done againt `OPNsense` `21.7` and `Home Assistant` `2021.10`.

# installation

# Installation

This integration currenlty **replaces** the built-in `OPNsense` integration
which only provides `device_tracker` functionality, be sure to remove any
associated configuration for the built-in integration before installing this
replacement.

The installation requires a plugin on `OPNsense` and a custom integration in `Home Assistant`.

## OPNsense_plugin

To use the integration you need to install an `OPNsense` plugin made available
on mimugmail repository: `https://www.routerperformance.net/opnsense-repo/`

First you need to install the repository:

- open an SSH session on `OPNsense` and issue the following commands:

```
fetch -o /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/mimugmail.conf https://www.routerperformance.net/mimugmail.conf
pkg update
```

Now you need to install the plugin, you have two ways to do it:

- In `OPNsense` web UI, go to System:Firmware:Plugins and install plugin `os-homeassistant-maxit`
- From SSH shell: `pkg install os-homeassistant-maxit`

## HomeAssistant_integration

In `Home Assistant`, add this repository to your `HACS` installation or clone the directory manually.

### HACS_installation

In HACS, add this as a custom repository: https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-opnsense then go to the
HACS integrations page, search for `OPNsense integration for Home Assistant` and install it. Once the
integration is installed be sure to restart `Home Assistant`.

### Manual_installation

Copy the contents of the custom_components folder to your `Home Assistant` config/custom_components
folder and restart `Home Assistant`.

# Configuration

Configuration is managed entirely from the UI using `config_flow` semantics.
Simply go to `Configuration -> Integrations -> Add Integration` and search for `OPNsense`
in the search box. If you can't find it in the list (well-known HA issue) you need to do
a 'hard-refresh' of the browser (ctrl-F5) then open the list again, you'll find it there.

## OPNsense

- Create a new user or choose an existing user, and create an API key associated to
  to that user. When creating the API key, `OPNsense` will push the API file containing
  the API key and API secret to your browser, you'll find it in the download folder.
- If using a non `admin` user account ensure the user has the following privileges:
  - `XMLRPC Library` (note that this privilege effectively gives the user complete access to
    the system via the `xmlrpc` feature)
  - `System:Firmware`

## config

- `URL` - the full URL to your `OPNsense` UI (ie: `https://192.168.1.1`),
  supported format is `<scheme>://<ip or host>[:<port>]`
- `Verify SSL Certificate` - if the SSL certificate should be verified or not
  (if you get an SSL error try unchecking this)
- `username` - the API key created previously
- `password` - the API secret of the API key
- `Firewall Name` - a custom name to be used for `entity` naming (default: use
  the `OPNsense` `hostname`)

## options

- `Scan Interval (seconds)` - scan interval to use for state polling (default:
  `30`)
- `Enable Device Tracker` - turn on the device tracker integration using
  `OPNsense` arp table (default: `false`)
- `Device Tracker Scan Interval (seconds)` - scan interval to use for arp
  updates (default: `60`)
- `Device Tracker Consider Home (seconds)` - seconds to wait until marking
  a device as not home after not being seen.
  (default: `0`)
  - `0` - disabled (if device is not present during any given scan interval it
    is considered away)
  - `> 0` - generally should be a multiple of the configured scan interval

# entities

Many `entities` are created by `hass-opnsense` for stats etc. Due to to volume
of entities many are disabled by default. If something is missing be sure to
review the disabled entities as what you're looking for is probably there.

## binary_sensor

- carp status (enabled/disabled)
- system notices present (the bell icon in the upper right of the UI)
- firmware updates available

## device_tracker

`ScannerEntity` entries are created for the `OPNsense` arp table. Disabled by
default. Not only is the feature disabled by default but created entities are
currently disabled by default as well. Search the disabled entity list for the
relevant mac addresses and enable as desired.

Note that by default `FreeBSD`/`OPNsense` use a max age of 20 minutes for arp
entries (sysctl `net.link.ether.inet.max_age`). You may lower that using
`System -> Advanced -> System Tunables` if desired.

Also note that if you are running `AdGuardHome` DNS queries may get throttled
causing issues with the tracker. See #22 for details.

## sensor

- system details (name, version, ~~temp~~, boottime, etc)
- pfstate details (used, max, etc)
- cpu details (average load, frequency, etc)
- mbuf details
- memory details
- filesystem usage
- interface details (status, stats, pps, kbs (time samples are based on the
  `Scan Interval (seconds)` config option))
- gateways details (status, delay, stddev, loss)
- carp interface status
- ~~dhcp stats (total, online, and offline clients)~~
- OpenVPN server stats (per-server basis - connected client count, bytes
  sent/received, kB/s sent/received)
- ARP table (count in ARP, all IPs, and broken up by "subnet")

## switch

All of the switches below are disabled by default.

- filter rules - enable/disable rules
- nat port forward rules - enable/disable rules
- nat outbound rules - enable/disable rules
- services - start/stop services (note that services must be enabled before they can be started)

# Known Issues

## AdGuardHome

As mentioned [here](https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-opnsense/issues/22) using AdGuardHome can lead to problems with the plugin.
Setting the Ratelimit in AdGuardHome to 0 will resolve this problem.
